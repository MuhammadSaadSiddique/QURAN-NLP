# QURAN NLP

Using NLP knowledge on the Quran and looking forward to making something amazing out of it!

## Motivation

I thought about using my knowledge of ML & NLP on the Quran to make something out of it. I have tried to
get summary of the Verses and Tafasir, getting the sentiment analysis, I have made a Search Engine so that 
any query can be searched as easily as a person does on Google

This is a open source project and I am trying to host it somewhere so people can use it and make the most out of it.

Collaborations are HIGHLY welcome! If anyone can help with the code or help fact check the search results or summaries 
that would be a HUGE help!

Looking forward to do something great with Quran & NLP
