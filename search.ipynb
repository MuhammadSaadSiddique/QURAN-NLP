It is also said that the lā negation of the verb yutīqūnahu is not actually implied because at the very beginning of Islam they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast as an obligation where God says So let those of you who are present at the month fast it Q. 2185 Ibn ‘Abbās said by way of qualification ‘Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding if they break their fast out of concern for the child; in the case of these two the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated’. For him who volunteers good by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that volunteering is good for him; but that you should fast wa-an tasūmū is the subject is better for you khayrun lakum is its predicate than breaking the fast and paying the redemption if you but knew that this is better for you then do it. + ((Fast) a certain number of days) 30 days; (and (for) him who is sick among you, or on a journey, (the same) number of other days) let him fast the same number of days he missed; (and for those who can afford it) afford to fast (there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need-) let him feed a person in need, instead of every day of the fast that he missed, half a measure of wheat. But this is abrogated by Allah's saying: (And whoever of you is present, let him fast the month). It is also said that this means: those who can afford a ransom and are not able to fast, old men and women who are unable to fast, they should feed a needy person, for every missed day of fast in Ramadan, half a measure of wheat. (But whoso doeth good of his own accord) gives more than two pounds, (it is better for him) in terms of reward: (and that ye fast is better for you) than giving ransom (if ye did but know-)\",\n",

But whoever amongst you is ill or suffers from some ailment of the head (and because of that gets his head shaved before time), then he has to recompense (it) by (keeping) fasts or (giving) alms or (offering) sacrifice. Then, when in peaceful condition, anyone of you who takes the advantage of combining ‘Umra (Visitation) with ±ajj (Pilgrimage) should (offer whatever) sacrifice is available.

To this last has been added the case of the one who shaves his head without excuse because the requirement of redemption is most obvious in his case; but also it is required in the case of one that enjoys without shaving such things as scents attire or oils be it with an excuse or without.

From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik al-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: “You should free a slave”. Aws said: “I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave”. The Prophet (pbuh) said: “Then you should fast two successive months”. Aws said: “I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast”. The Prophet (pbuh) said: “Then you should feed 60 needy ones”. Aws said: “I can not afford it”. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: “I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I”. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wife whom he had declared unlawful for himself.\",\n",

They are like clothes for you and you are like clothes for them. Allah knows that you broke the trust in the case of your own right. But He has shown mercy to you and has forgiven you. So, have sexual relations with them now (during the nights of the fasts without any inhibition) and seek what Allah has prescribed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you (separated) from the black thread (of night). Then complete the fast till dusk. And refrain from having sexual contact with your wives, whilst you are in retreat in the mosques. These are the bounds (set) by Allah. So do not draw near to them (to step over). Thus Allah explains His Verses (clearly) for the people, so that they may embrace piety. + Permitted to you, upon the night of the Fast, is to go in to your wives; -- they are a vestment for you, and you are a vestment for them. God knows that you have been betraying yourselves, and has turned to you and pardoned you. So now lie with them, and seek what God has prescribed for you. And eat and drink, until the white thread shows clearly to you from the black thread at the dawn; then complete the Fast unto the night, and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques. Those are God’s bounds; keep well within them. So God makes clear His signs to men; haply they will be godfearing. + It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast. They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits imposed by Allah, so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they may ward off (evil). +  | Permitted to you upon the night of the Fast is to go in to your wives in sexual intercourse this was revealed as an abrogation of its unlawfulness during the earliest phase of Islam as well as an abrogation of the unlawfulness of eating and drinking after the night prayer; they are a vestment for you and you are a vestment for them a metaphor for their embraces or their need for one another; God knows that you have been betraying yourselves by having sexual intercourse on the eve of the fast this happened with ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb and others and they apologised to the Prophet s and so He has turned to you relenting before you even turned in repentance and He has pardoned you. So now when it is permitted to you lie with them in sexual intercourse and seek what God has prescribed for you of sexual intercourse or what it produces of offspring; and eat and drink at any time during the night until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak that is the true moment of daybreak which explains the white thread while the explanation of the black thread namely the night has been left out. The whiteness and the darkness of the dawn twilight are likened to two black and white threads in the way they stretch out; then complete the fast from daybreak to the night that is until it arrives after the setting of the sun; and do not lie with them your women while you cleave to the mosques in devotion to God while you are residing therein with the intention of performing i‘tikāf ‘spiritual retreat’. This was a prohibition pertaining to one who used to leave the mosque whilst in a state of i‘tikāf have sexual intercourse with his wife and then return. Those rulings mentioned are God’s bounds delimited by God for His servants so that they do not overstep them; do not approach them lā taqrabūhā is more intense than lā ta‘taddūhā ‘Do not overstep’ used in verses elsewhere. So just as He makes clear to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear disobeying His prohibitions. + (It is made lawful for you to go unto your wives on the night of the fast) for sexual intercourse. (They are raiment for you) a repose for you (and you are raiment for them) a repose for them. (Allah is aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect) by having sexual intercourse with them at night (and He hath turned in mercy towards you) He forgave you (and relieved you) from your deception and did not punish you. (So) now that it is made lawful, (hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you) to have a righteous child; this verse was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, (and eat and drink) from the time the night falls (until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn) i.e. until the light of day becomes distinct to you from the darkness of night. (Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall) the beginning of nightfall; this verse was revealed about Sirmah Ibn Malik Ibn 'Adiyy (and touch them not) do not have sexual intercourse with them, (while you are at your devotions) in pious retreat (in the mosques) whether this is during the day or the night. (These are the limits imposed by Allah) such sexual intercourse is a transgression against Allah, (so approach them not) abstain from having sexual intercourse with your wives, during the day and at night, while you are in such retreats. (Thus Allah expoundeth His revelations) His commands and prohibitions (to mankind) as He has exposited this matter (that they may ward off (evil)) they may ward off transgressing against Him. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) among whom were 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib and 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, who were in retreat in the mosque and used to go to their wives whenever they needed them, and then take a ritual bath and return to the mosque. Henceforth but they were forbidden to do so.\",\n",
